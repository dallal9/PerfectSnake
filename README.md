# Perfect Snake Game
A solver for snake game 

 Snake game is a well-known game where the goal is to control a “snake” and collect food from a map. In this project, we explore one of the methods that are used to solve the classic game of snake, producing a perfect solver for the game. Our method is based on graph theory where we make use of Hamiltonian cycle.
 

## Requirements: 
- Python 3.5+ (64-bit)
- pygame (pip install pygame)


## Run the game:

```
$ python run_game.py
```

## Controls 
```
d = speed up
a = speed down
space = pause
```
